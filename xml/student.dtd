  Since year and status both have a restricted set of data that can they can contain,
  it is better to use an attribute since it can be better regulated.

  The attribute used is "y" for year and "s" for status, and they both have the #REQUIRED
  tag meaning that the attribute cannot be omitted.

<!ATTLIST year
          y (First-Year|Second-Year|Third-Year|Fourth-Year|Non-Traditional) #REQUIRED>

<!ATTLIST status
          s (full-time|part-time|graduated|withdrawn) #REQUIRED>
